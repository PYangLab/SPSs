# Functional analysis of the stable phosphoproteome

The advance of mass spectrometry-based technologies enabled the profiling of the phosphoproteomes of a multitude of cell and tissue types. However, current research primarily focused on investigating the phosphorylation dynamics in specific cell types and experimental conditions, whereas the phosphorylation events that are common across cell/tissue types and stable regardless of experimental conditions are, so far, mostly ignored. Here, we developed a statistical framework to identify the stable phosphoproteome across 53 human phosphoproteomics datasets, covering 40 cell/tissue types and 194 conditions/treatments. We demonstrate that the stably phosphorylated sites (SPSs) identified from our statistical framework are evolutionarily conserved, functionally important, and enriched in a range of core signalling and gene pathways. In particular, we show that SPSs are highly enriched in the RNA splicing pathway, an essential cellular process in mammalian cells, and frequently disrupted by cancer mutations, suggesting a link between the dysregulation of RNA splicing and cancer development through mutations on SPSs.
